If some regulatory authorities intervene or exert influence on the project, the InvestDigital Team may receive queries, notices, warnings, requests or rulings from one or more regulatory authorities from time to time, or may even be ordered to suspend or discontinue any action in connection with the Campaign, InvestDigital’s development or IDT. The development, marketing, promotion or otherwise of InvestDigital or the IDT crowdsale campaign may be seriously affected, hindered or terminated as a result. And since regulatory policies could change from time to time, existing regulatory permission or tolerance on InvestDigital or the IDT crowdsale campaign in any jurisdiction could be just temporary. IDT could be defined from time to time as virtual commodity, digital asset or even securities or currency in various jurisdictions and therefore could be prohibited from being traded or held in certain jurisdictions pursuant to local regulatory requirements.",
